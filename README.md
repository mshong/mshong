# Professional Background
### Academic Roles:
- Currently teaching **Engineering Information Processing** at the Dept. of Mechnical Eng., Yonsei University.
- Teaching **C Programming** and **Python Programming** at the Dept. of Computer, Korea University.
- Previously served as a **Cooperation Professor** at Korea University for 5 years, teaching **Signals and Systems** and **Discrete Math**.
### Technical Expertise:
- Video codec algorithms and IP design
- Display-related algorithms and IP design
- Camera ISP algorithms
- Algorithm development using Python
- IP design using Verilog HDL
- Developing video compression technologies, display technology, and image signal processing mostly.
- Lately, I have been interested in machine learning and deep learning with Python.
# Recent Projects:
- **DSC(Display Stream Compression)**: A video compression standard developed by VESA (Video Electronics Standards Association) that is used to reduce the amount of data needed to transmit high-quality video. More information can be found at [DSC](https://vesa.org/vesa-display-compression-codecs/#tab-dsc).
- **VDC-M(Video Display Compression M)**: Another video compression standard developed by VESA that is designed for high-end displays, such as those used in medical and aerospace applications. More information can be found at [VDC-M](https://vesa.org/vesa-display-compression-codecs/#tab-vdc-m).
- **De-Mura Compensation**: A technique used to compensate for stains that may appear in the process of producing uLED/OLED displays.
- **Dead Pixel Compensation**: A technique used to compensate for dead pixels that may appear in the process of producing uLED/OLED displays.
- **Bilinear and Bicubic Video Scaler**: Algorithms used to increase or decrease the size of an image while maintaining its quality.
- **Image Signal Processing**: Alogorithms used to enhance image qualities for SWIR CMOS image sensors.
