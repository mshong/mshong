### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am currently working on Sapien Semiconductor in Seoul Korea. I am developing IPs for VLSI and interested in Video Codec(VESA Standards DSC and VDC-M), De-Mura compensation, dead pixel compensation and video scaler for micro LEDs.

I lectured on digital signal processing and discrete mathematics as a cooperation professor at Korea University. Now, I started Github because I wanted to share both theoriotic and pratical knowledge with many people.

I hope to meet you soon on the subject through examples coded in Python and Verilog HDL.
